# job-market-analysis-

This project focuses on analyzing real-world job market trends by scraping and processing job listings from online portals. Using Python (Selenium & BeautifulSoup), I collected 1,000+ job posts across multiple locations, extracting key attributes including salary, experience requirements, skills, and company details. The scraped data was cleaned and transformed using Pandas to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize text.

The processed dataset was stored in a MySQL database where advanced SQL operations such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIKE, and HAVING were used to derive actionable business insights, including top hiring locations, most demanded skills, experience-level job trends, and company-wise hiring patterns
